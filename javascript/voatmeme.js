And, I\'m sure when used responsibly (better yet, legally) and without pushing it on others, there are no major negative consequences (yes, I know it can\'t kill you). Never used it myself since I\'m straightedge, but I\'m sure if I did, I\'d never want to consider myself a \"stoner\".This is because the culture behind it is absolutely vile to me and I despise it more with every passing day. The pious, arrogant love that stoners have for that spiky green leaf is so extreme that it\'s baffling, but what exacerbates the issue is how online, no-one is allowed to have any negative opinion about it. At all. Even if you don\'t smoke it, you just have to praise the herb. Yet, from what I\'ve seen online, stoners do absolutely nothing to make the plant look good. Instead, they\'ve utterly killed it. The idiotic culture surrounding it makes me want to stay far, far away from marijuana. I\'ve always found any kind of smoking unpleasant, but I could at least accept marijuana smoking if it wasn\'t shoved in my face from every direction.The incessant need for stoners to defend marijuana and encourage other people to smoke it comes across as profoundly obnoxious (\"420 blaze it faggot!\", \"Smoke weed everyday!\", \"Just get high, bro!\) . Furthermore, many stoners like to see the plant as a magical force that can unite the world in peace, and yet it is prominent in the very nasty, un-peaceful gangster culture. Even as it gets gradually legalised throughout the world, its dark reputation will always linger. It\'s not a "nice" subject, it\'s disturbing and lowbrow. Pictures and videos of smoking are ugly and creepy. Weed-related humor is terrible and intelligence-insulting, especially in memes. Songs about it, especially ones promoting it, are almost always complete crap (Miley Cyrus\'s abysmal "Dooo It!" being the absolute nadir). Celebrating the use of it on 4/20 is even worse and comes across as really scummy and pathetic. How exactly am I supposed to NOT see it is disgusting? It\'s uncomfortable and unpleasant to think about.And that\'s why I hate marijuana culture. The whole thing is endlessly creepy, filthy, obnoxious and moronic. Am I really the only person who feels this way? I can\'t stand it, and I feel so alone in this specific mindset."
